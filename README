Led blinking demo for STM32 model STM32F103VET6
===============================================

Makefile is based on STM32F103ZET6Led example taken from http://www.scienceprog.com/led-blinky-demo-on-stm32f103zet6-development-board/ 
Source and linker script taken from https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3-examples miniblink demo

Hardware configuration
======================
Development board used: HY-STM32_100P with 2.4" LCD (see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqg3AJ9PEVg similar board)
RAM: 64kb
FLASH: 512kb
Led configuration according to the datashit:
 * Led D1: PC6(from schematics), means port GPIOC, pin 6
 * Led D2: PC7(from schematics), means port GPIOC, pin 7
 * Led D3: Pd13(from schematics), means port GPIOD, pin 13
 * Led D4: PD6(from schematics), means port GPIOD, pin 6

Dependencies
============
In order to use one must download the STM32 libopencm3 library:
 * git clone git://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3.git
Project page: http://libopencm3.org/wiki/Main_Page

Development environment
=======================
 * Platform: Mac OS X 10.8 
 * Toolchain: Sourcery CodeBench Lite toolchain, build from the source using James Sneyder's Makefile(https://github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain)
 * USBtoRS232 device: PL2303 with the driver http://xbsd.nl/2011/07/pl2303-serial-usb-on-osx-lion.html
 * In order to flash the program one can use the https://code.google.com/p/stm32flash/ flash program
   Run the 'make flash' command to flash (assuming that the RS232 device is /dev/tty.PL2303-000013FA and stm32flash is in PATH)
 * Also tested with the st-link/v2 and st-util (https://github.com/texane/stlink)
